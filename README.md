# Welcome to my improved Rock-Paper Scissors Game!
Rock-Paper Scissors was my first hackathon project. 
In my first iteration, I had 1 large function to carry out the first game then many smaller ones to try to create a looping game. The current (second) iteration  now has separate functions to carry out individual components of the game. 
The next interation would involve creating a page with buttons to imporve UI/UX and create a better game experience as a whole.
